# Returning tables to DuckDB (Python → DuckDB)

Reference card for sending Arrow-encoded tables from `RunPython` back into DuckDB. Fetched on demand via `CallSkill('python-pass-data')`.

In `RunPython`, assign `arrow_tables` in globals — each entry is auto-loaded as a DuckDB table of the same name (replacing any prior table with that name) and re-published to the input registry:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa

def to_ipc(df):
    table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
    sink = pa.BufferOutputStream()
    with pa.ipc.new_stream(sink, table.schema) as writer:
        writer.write_table(table)
    return sink.getvalue().to_pybytes()

arrow_tables = {
    "sales": to_ipc(pd.DataFrame({"region": ["a", "b"], "amount": [10, 20]})),
}
```

After that runs, the next `RunSQL` can `SELECT * FROM sales`, and a later `RunPython` sees `arrow_inputs["sales"]` (encoding `arrow-ipc`).
